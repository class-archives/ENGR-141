Question No 1:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If the bins are sealed, what qualities differ between the bins?


The bins can be distinguished by mass. The weight of the three different types of bins will be as follows:
Organic material bin: 65 grams +/- 10 grams
Ceramic material bin: 95  grams +/- 10 grams
Metallic material bin: 125 grams +/- 10 grams

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question No 2:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How will the bins be positioned at the post-processing station, with regard to the closed-loop path?


A bin that is ready for transport will be centered on the path in an upright orientation (i.e., the long axis of the bin will be perpendicular to the ground), sitting on the ground level. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question No 3:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Relative to the path, how will the predefined staging locations for the bins be placed?


The circle representing the bin drop-off location will be centered on the path. A bin can be deposited anywhere within the circle and in any orientation. All bins located within the circle at the end of the demonstration will be considered delivered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question No 4: 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Will the branching paths from the closed-loop path (i.e. to the post-processing station and the shipping container)  be on the outside
or inside of the loop?


The PMR will be placed in a location designated as the shipping container. A path will lead the PMR from the shipping container to the primary path. You will have an opportunity to pre-position your PMR in the shipping container so that it starts on the path.

The location of the shredder station will be denoted by a bin positioned on the path. Once a bin is full, the shredder station will deposit a bin centered on the path and sitting on the ground level.

There will be three (3) bin drop-off locations: the first location will be for bins containing organic materials, the second location will be for bins containing ceramic materials, and the third location will be for bins containing metallic materials. These locations will be observable to the naked eye (imagine that someone has walked around a very large open field and put a small stake in the ground with a flag on it to indicate the location where the bins are to be deposited). 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question No 5:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How will the closed-loop path be shaped (i.e. circular, rectangular, etc.)?


The shape of the path is not really relevant. However, the best description is that it is circuitous closed-looped path.
